## SQL Practice

- **SQL**: Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database.

### Summary of Relational Databases

- **Structure**: Data is organized into tables, where each table represents a specific entity or concept, such as customers, products, or orders.

- **Tables**: Each table consists of rows and columns. Rows represent individual instances of the entity being stored, while columns represent attributes or properties of those instances.

- **Relationships**: Tables can be related to each other through common fields or keys. This allows for complex data relationships to be established, such as linking customers to their orders.

- **Data Integrity**: Relational databases enforce data integrity through various mechanisms such as primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints. These ensure that data is accurate, consistent, and reliable.

- **Query Language**: Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to interact with relational databases. SQL provides a standardized way to perform operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.

- **Normalization**: Relational databases are often normalized to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency. Normalization involves organizing data into multiple tables and minimizing data duplication.

- **Scalability and Performance**: Relational databases can scale to handle large volumes of data and are designed for efficient querying and data retrieval.
