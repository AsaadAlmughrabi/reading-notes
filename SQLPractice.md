## SQL Practice

- **SQL**: Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database.

- **SELECT**: To retrieve data from a SQL database. Syntax: `SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition;`
  - `SELECT column, another_column, …FROM mytable`;
  - `SELECT * FROM mytable;`

- **Queries with constraints**: `SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition
    AND/OR another_condition
    AND/OR …;`
