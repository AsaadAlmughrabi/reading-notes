## SQL vs. NoSQL Databases: A Comparison

| Feature         | SQL (Relational)                                                                | NoSQL (Non-Relational)                                                           |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Structure**    | Tables with rows and columns, strict schema                                    | Flexible data models (key-value, document, graph, wide column)                       |
| **Relationships** | Enforced through relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)           | Not strictly enforced                                                               |
| **Query Language** | SQL (Structured Query Language)                                               | Varies depending on the type (e.g., MongoDB Query Language, Cypher for Neo4j)      |
| **Examples**     | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server                               | MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Neo4j                                                    |
| **Strengths**    | Structured data, complex queries, ACID compliance, data integrity                | Scalability, flexible schema, unstructured data, high performance                   |
| **Weaknesses**   | Less flexible schema, vertical scaling can be expensive                        | Eventual consistency, complex queries can be challenging                             |

## ORMs (Object Relational Mappers)

* **Purpose:** Bridge the gap between object-oriented code and relational databases.
* **How it Works:** Translates objects into database operations, avoiding raw SQL.
* **Benefits:** Increased productivity, database independence, better code organization.
* **Drawbacks:** Potential performance overhead, learning curve.

## Django Models

* **Integration:** Built-in ORM in the Django web framework.
* **Style:** Define models as Python classes, Django handles database interactions.
* **Features:** Automatic migrations, query API, validation, admin interface.
* **Advantage:** Simplifies and accelerates web development with databases.

## Additional Notes

* **Django and NoSQL:** Django's ORM is primarily designed for SQL databases. While some third-party libraries exist to integrate Django with NoSQL databases, it's not officially supported and can be more complex.
