## EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE SELF-ASSESSMENT TOOL 
Upon reviewing my scores, I've noticed that I'm pretty good at understanding and managing my own emotions (self-awareness and self-management). However, I could work on understanding others better and improving how I handle relationships (social awareness and relationship management). This means I need to focus more on empathy and communication skills to build better connections with people. It's clear that there's room for growth, but I'm excited to learn and improve in these areas.

## Bias Self-Assessment Results
Based on the Bias Self-Assessment, my strongest area appears to be empathy and curiosity. I scored highest in recognizing and trying to understand different perspectives, even when they make me uncomfortable. In the coming weeks and beyond, I'll focus on improving my effectiveness in courage. This means I'll work on advocating for myself and others, even in challenging situations. My weakest area seems to be meaningful connections. While I value dissenting opinions, I may need to actively seek out diverse perspectives to broaden my network and enhance collaboration. Considering my score range falls between 75 and 99, I understand that I've made progress but still have room to grow. Therefore, I'll prioritize examining where I can improve based on 2 or 3 of the 8 areas of unconscious bias where I scored the lowest.
