## 2. NumPy (Numerical Python)

NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It enables:

- Creation of multidimensional arrays (e.g., matrices, tensors).
- Mathematical operations (e.g., addition, multiplication, trigonometry).
- Efficient data manipulation (e.g., slicing, reshaping, broadcasting).

NumPy is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning.

## 3. Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a Python library for creating visualizations, including static, animated, and interactive plots. It features:

- Line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, and more.
- Customization options for labels, colors, and styles.
- Integration with Jupyter notebooks and other Python environments.

## 4. Data Science

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that combines:

- **Domain Knowledge**: Understanding the context and problem domain.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Extracting insights from data using statistical methods.
- **Machine Learning**: Building predictive models and algorithms.
- **Programming**: Implementing solutions using programming languages like Python.

## 5. Python Basics: Numpy 3D Array

Working with three-dimensional arrays (3D arrays) using NumPy involves:

- **Creation**: Constructing 3D arrays from lists or other arrays.
- **Indexing**: Accessing specific elements within the 3D array.
- **Operations**: Performing mathematical operations (e.g., element-wise addition).
- **Applications**: Using 3D arrays in scientific simulations, image processing, and more.
